<P>This website will be a working example as I learn web development.  I've started with HTML and CSS, and so far so good.  Next I'm getting into Javascript and Jquery.  Further down the line I'll be looking into Django, MangoDB, JSON, Node.js, Angular.js and of course Ajax and Bootstrap.  All of this in no particular order.</P>


<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>As Time Goes On</h3>

<p>As I move on and learn more, I'll try to blog post "update" on my lessons, and insights I've thought about while learning.  I am not a programmer by any means, I am actually a Geologist who, through work related activities, started using Python in a GIS environment.  And it was though this, that I'm here today, wanting to learn more about this side of technology.  Up until last year, I was a hardware guy, but not anymore.</p>
<p>I'll also learn to add a comments section, for any suggestions, comments and more then likely, a few trolls.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Git</h3>

<p>Well, the first step to all of this is using Git properly.  A little confusing at first, but the big part is just getting the concept and simple commands first.  GitBook and YouTube have great resources to help.</p>
